# Enhanced Report Generation Prompt Refinements

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive prompt refinements made to improve the quality, tone, and investment focus of the AI-generated research reports based on analysis of expected vs. actual content quality.

## Problem Analysis

### Issues Identified in Original Content:
1. **Generic titles** - "Apple Inc. Q3 2025 Financial Results Update" vs. engaging "Clean Across The Board As Eyes Turn To S232 & US v. GOOGL"
2. **Risk-focused tone** - Overly conservative, emphasizing misses rather than strengths and growth drivers
3. **Variance-only takeaways** - Limited to metric comparisons vs. strategic insights and momentum indicators
4. **Weak investment narrative** - Missing engaging analyst voice and forward-looking perspective
5. **Technical reporting style** - Lacked the compelling, confident tone of professional sell-side research

## Prompt Refinements Made

### 1. Enhanced System Messages

**Before:**
```
You are a professional equity research assistant trained to generate concise, factual, and investor-grade research updates.
```

**After:**
```
You are a senior equity research analyst at a top-tier investment bank generating investor-grade research reports. Your writing style should be confident, engaging, and forward-looking, focusing on investment implications and growth drivers.

Rules:
- Emphasize positive momentum, growth drivers, and strategic positioning alongside any concerns.
- Use engaging analyst language: "sigh of relief," "tough to nitpick," "clean across the board," etc.
- Focus on forward-looking investment implications and catalysts.
- Balance performance commentary with strategic insights and market positioning.
```

### 2. Title Prompt Enhancement

**Key Improvements:**

- "Broad-Based Beat Drives Momentum Into iPhone Cycle"
- "Services Strength Offsets iPhone Headwinds"

### 3. Key Takeaways Transformation

**Before:** Focus only on variance analysis (metric + variance vs estimate)

**After:** Comprehensive strategic insights including:
- Growth drivers and positive momentum indicators
- Key operational achievements or strategic developments  
- Performance vs estimates (where material)

- Key growth drivers and momentum indicators
- Forward-looking catalysts or concerns

**Tone example:** "This was Apple's strongest quarterly report/guide in 2+ years, with outperformance broad-based across Product/Services and regions."
