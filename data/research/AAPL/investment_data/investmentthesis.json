    "investmentThesis": "<p>With the largest base of pent up iPhone demand ever (i.e. most elongated replacement cycles), new AI features rolling out (slowly) around the world, and a renewed focus on device form factor changes, we believe Apple can accelerate iPhone growth starting in FY26, before replacement cycles contract in the 2 years thereafter. When combined with consistent, double digit services growth, gross margin stability, and moderate operating leverage, we believe Apple can earn $8.30 in CY26 and $8.80 by FY27. Longer-term, investments in AI, payments, cloud, health, and home, and long runway to grow spend per user from $1/day today are key arguments for sustained long-term growth and value creation.</p>",
